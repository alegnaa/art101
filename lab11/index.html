					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JS events.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>for some reason i really struggled with making it work, and i 
						couldn't figure out why since all of my code was the exact 
						same and the one provided. I opened lab 11 from wmodes github 
						website, and even then i couldn't figure out the problem because 
						it was all the same. I would just stare at my screen re-reading, 
						trying to figure out why the string wasn't working. i eventually 
						accepted defeat and opened the ai modes bot and asked it questions. 
						It couldn't figure out my problem either, it was the code looked 
						fine and that i should do console.log to see what wasn't working. 
						As i was typing in the console.log, i realised i mistyped something, 
						and hoped and prayed that that wasn't the reason why i had been 
						stressing out. Sure enough, it was the typo that was messing it all 
						up.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>apart from stressing out over the typo because the code all looked 
						fine, it was a fairly simple lab that did not require a lot of work 
						since i understand the topic and concept mostly.</p>
