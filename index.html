						<h4>Jorge</h4>	
						<p>Jorge is a goat that my aunt has in her ranch. I named him a few days after he was born 
							so she's obligated to not sell him or turn him into Birria ^^</p>

							<h4>Allium 1.0</h4>	
							<p>Allium was the first bird my sister got, about 3 months before Allium 2.0. Unfortunately, 
								Allium 1.0 did not last very long, as we think she was too young and was prolly affected 
								from being separated from her mom and not eating well. RIP in pieces Allium, you were 
								our first experience with pet loss. She may have lived with us for a few weeks, but we 
								loved her just as much as every other pet.</p>
