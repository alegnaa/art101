			<div class="minor-section-lab4">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab is supposed to help us get into the habit of thinking in 
						terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding. So we Pseudocode 
						a simple computer game
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section-lab4">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Once we decided what game we wanted to do, we couldnt figure out how 
						simple to make the instructions, or if we had to make it in a way 
						that was eligible for JavaScript. So instead, we wrote out the steps 
						on how to play the game and then step by step turned it into steps 
						that JS could probably understand.</p>

// Print Board
  // 6 circles on each side with a long oval on either side of the board
  // 4 stones in each circle
// Two users
// Player 1 chooses a circle on their side to take stones from
  // Pick up the stones in the space chosen
// Starting with the next space, drop one stone in each space going counterclockwise (including the Store) until all of the stones are played out
  // A player can go again if the stone ends in their store
// Once player 1 can not move anymore player 2 repeats step b
// Step b is continued until a player has no more stones in their six circles. 
// Test for win or draw condition
