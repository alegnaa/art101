					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Experiment with jQuery by making buttons and making them have an action.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="problem">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I did't fully understand how to use jQuery, and so when I tried experimenting on my own,
					I had some problems, and honestly was stressing out. Once the lab changed my partner and I 
					struggled with the event listener, and I honestly have no idea what i kept messing up, if 
					it was because i might've had the old code still, or i mis-linked something, idk, but 
					eventually he helped me out and I got everything working again.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="ref">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Linking and actually getting the jQuery took a bit but once I actually got it, it was pretty
						easy to understand and execute.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<p>click the buttons for some very nice and organized, not chaotic at all, colors :) (you'll definitely be able to go back)</p>
