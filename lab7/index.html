					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I wanted to learn how to make the javascript look nice and have 
						silly outputs on different sections on the screen but I couldnt
						 figure out on my own. I would've asked for help but I really 
						 just wanted to see if I could do it on my own. (spoiler alert, 
						 i couldnt)</p>
