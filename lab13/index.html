			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with loops.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I really struggled with trying to have js output the results on 
						the html, and since neither of use really understand how to use 
						the code given to us on the assignment tast description, we decided 
						to ask wesbot since it was the closest we could get to help during 
						the holiday break. It did give us some code that we don't recognize, 
						but we added it and it executed the results well. we fixed it so that 
						it works well with our code, and we also asked it to help us with some 
						other problems we were having.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I understood strings and loops when we were learning about them, but 
						actually trying to figure them out on our own during the break was a 
						little challenging. I did end up resorting to ai to help, which probably 
						didn't help me do the lab correctly, but it gave the same results.</p>
