			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There weren't any problems, just that I tried to figure out how to get the 
						code to say something twice depending on what the input was at the same 
						time. After i figured it out, i realized it was really simple.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Debugging</h2>
					<p>I didn’t have anything to de-bug, so I decided to just do task X for Lab 12. 
						I just added another function with the same code as the sorting function, 
						but instead of the name of the house, it’s the description of it. After that 
						I got the same code in the myButton variable and duplicated it and changed 
						the names so that it fits the second function and so that it doesn’t overlap 
						with the first variables in it. So now the outputs are the names and the 
						descriptions at the same time.</p>
